### 10 Principles for Good Design

- A bit more suited for industrial design than for digital design.

A well-designed product is...
1. **Innovative**: The possibilities for innovation are never exhausted, even though it might appear so at times. However, technological progress opens new doors every day. Innovative design must go hand in hand with innovative technology.
2. **Useful**: Products are bought to be used. Anything that detracts from usefulness must be discarded.
3. **Aesthetic**: While usefulness is integral, a product must also satisfy psychological and aesthetic requirements. Aesthetics are also important for usefulness because products we use every day affect our person and our wellbeing. 
4. **Understandable**: Good design clarifies the product's structure. Also, it can make the product talk.
5. **Unobtrusive**: Products that fulfill a purpose are like tools. Their design should be neutral and restrained, and leave room for user's self-expression.
6. **Honest**: Good design doesn't lie. It doesn't make the product more innovative, powerful or valuable than it actually is. It doesn't make promises that it can't deliver.
7.  **Long-lasting**: Good design avoids being fashionable and therefore never gets antiquated. Well-designed products last many years, even in today's fast, throwaway society.
8. **Thorough**: Nothing is arbitrary or left to chance. Care and accuracy in the design process are a sign of respect
