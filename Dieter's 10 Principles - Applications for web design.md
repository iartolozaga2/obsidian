### Applications for web design
- Making websites easy to interact with to the point that the user delights in it. "This is user enjoyment through user enablement".
- The design should always show the user what its function is so that there’s never a gap between what the user perceives the design’s capabilities are and what they truly are (Similar to Visibility of System Status in the [[10 Usability Heuristics]]).
- Think about the journey the user goes through in the app. There are positive and negative interactions. Think of traffic lights: green means go (positive); red means stop (negative).
- Not building unneeded elements into the web designs. Remember the [[80/20 Rule]] and think carefully before adding every element to avoid clutter.
