# Welcome to IÃ±igo's Digital BrainðŸ§ 

This is a personal project with which I aim to build a digital auxiliary mega-resource for myself (and for whoever else is interested) in which I will store and organize knowledge that I want to have quick and comprehensive access to in the future.

## How this Digital Brain is structured

The structure of this Digital Brain (DB hereinafter) is inspired by Tiago Forte's [[P.A.R.A. Framework]]. This means that each node in the DB will belong to one of these two groups:

- **Project:** Nodes that talk about projects that I am currently undertaking, either academically, professionally or personally. 
- These projects fall under an **Area of Responsibility**, which is also a key element of the [[P.A.R.A. Framework]].
- **Resource:** Information that I consider worth keeping and could be of interest for one or more project, either present or future.
- **Archive:** If I deem it necessary, I will archive Projects or Resources that I complete or discard in order not to clog the DB with irrelevant information.
