# Welcome to IÃ±igo's Digital BrainðŸ§ 

This is a personal project with which I aim to build a digital auxiliary mega-resource for myself (and for whoever else is interested) in which I will store and organize knowledge that I want to have quick and comprehensive access to in the future.

## How this Digital Brain is structured

The structure of this Digital Brain (DB hereinafter) is inspired by Tiago Forte's [[P.A.R.A. Framework]]. This means that each node in the DB will belong to one or more of these groups:

- **Project:** Nodes that talk about projects that I am currently undertaking, either academically, professionally or personally. 
- These projects fall under an **Area of Responsibility**, which is also a key element of the [[P.A.R.A. Framework]].
- **Resource:** Information that I consider worth keeping and could be of interest for one or more project, either present or future.
- If I deem it necessary, I will **Archive** Projects or Resources that I complete or discard in order not to clog the DB with irrelevant information.

Nodes use tags to get classified into these categories.

For example, looking at the node [[Building my UX Portfolio]]:
- It is the main page of the #BuildingPortfolio **project**.
- It's overarching **area of responsibility** is #ProfessionalDevelopment.
- It compiles various **resources** that are relevant to the project.

## Getting started

### Projects
The most logical way to start to explore this DB is to access the project you are most interested in. These are the current ones present in this repository:

- #BuildingPortfolio: My project to build a UX Portfolio for myself, from scratch.
- #DigitalBrain: My project to construct a Digital Brain for myself. You're in it right now!

### Areas of Responsibility

- #PersonalDevelopment: Contains projects related to my journey to become a functioning adult.
- #ProfessionalDevelopment: Contains projects related to my objective of being a
