### 10 Principles for Good Design
- A bit more suited for industrial design than for digital design.

A well-designed product is...
1. **Innovative**: The possibilities for innovation are never exhausted, even though it might appear so at times. However, technological progress opens new doors every day. Innovative design must go hand in hand with innovative technology.
2. **Useful**: Products are bought to be used. Anything that detracts from usefulness must be discarded.
3. **Aesthetic**: While usefulness is integral, a product must also satisfy psychological and aesthetic requirements. Aesthetics are also important for usefulness because products we use every day affect our person and our wellbeing. 
4. **Understandable**: Good design clarifies the product's structure. Also, it can make the product talk.
5. **Unobtrusive**: Products that fulfill a purpose are like tools. Their design should be neutral and restrained, and leave room for user's self-expression.
6. **Honest**: Good design doesn't lie. It doesn't make the product more innovative, powerful or valuable than it actually is. It doesn't make promises that it can't deliver.
7.  **Long-lasting**: Good design avoids being fashionable and therefore never gets antiquated. Well-designed products last many years, even in today's fast, throwaway society.
8. **Thorough**: Nothing is arbitrary or left to chance. Care and accuracy in the design process are a sign of respect for the user.
9. **Environmentally-friendly**: Good design contributes to the preservation of the environment. It conserves resources and minimizes pollution throughout the life cycle of the product.
10. **Subtle**: "Less, but better". Focuses on the essential aspects, doesn't bother with the non-essentials. Purity and simplicity.


### Applications for web design
- Making websites easy to interact with to the point that the user delights in it. "This is user enjoyment through user enablement".
- The design should always show the user what its function is so that there’s never a gap between what the user perceives the design’s capabilities are and what they truly are (Similar to Visibility of System Status in the [[10 Usability Heuristics]]).
- Think about the journey the user goes through in the app. There are positive and negative interactions. Think of traffic lights: green means go (positive); red means stop (negative).
- Not building unneeded elements into the web designs. Remember the [[80/20 Rule]] and think carefully before adding every element to avoid clutter.
