# Information overload for drivers

### Learn from helis?
- Apache helicopter pilot interfaces have undergone extreme changes due to R&D that proved that a UI crowded with too many complex elements affects the ability to concentrate on the surrounding environment.
- Similarly to helicopters, driving cars requires an immense, almost complete level of concentration. Any distraction from the road results in less attention dedicated to keeping yourself and everyone around you safe.
- *“We are instrumenting the car in a way that is overloading the driver just like we were overloading the helicopter pilots,”* says David Strayer, director of University of Utah's Center for the Prevention of Distracted Driving.
- Even though sometimes the infotainment systems warn the driver about lane departure and blind spot hazards, the road deaths continue to rise.

### Drivers are more and more on their phones
- A poll by Nationwide Insurance claims that 50% of all car crashes are caused by distracted driving. And yet, 70% of the polled individuals claimed to use the cellphone while driving.
- Another survey by State Farm has results that say that more than half of people "always" or "often" read or send text messages while driving, 43% watched cellphone videos always or often while driving, and more than a third said that they always or often drive while video calling someone.
- It's obviously bad that people are on the phone while driving, but the solution is **not** to integrate the same functionalities in the car's infotainment system, as most car manufacturers are doing.
- Apple and Samsung are also responsible for this trend, as they are working hand in hand with car manufacturers to integrate their software in the cars.
