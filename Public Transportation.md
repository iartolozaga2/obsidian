Using Public Transportation means that you do not have to drive. This means that you don't have to dedicate your undivided attention to the road.

While drivers experience [[Cognitive overload]] from having to pay attention to the road and being exposed to uncountable sources of information and sensory stimuli (see [[Information oveload for drivers]]), Public Transport users can work, read, play games, listen to music or dedicate their attention to anything they want without worrying about endangering other people's lives.
