Jakob's Law of Internet User Experience

Related to the user's expectations of [[Usability]] in your online service.

In short:
"Users spend most of their time in other sites. This means that users expect and prefer your site to work the same way as all other sites they already know. Design for patterns for which users are accustomed."
