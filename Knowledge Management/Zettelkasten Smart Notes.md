[[Zettelkasten]] is a method in which "Smart Notes" are taken. This consists of three steps in [[Note-taking]]:

1. Fleeting Notes
	- These should be jotted down right as the information is being received IRL.
	- No attention should be paid to the format. There can even be no format at all.
	- The objective of these notes are to capture important concepts quickly.

2. Literature Notes
	- After the fact, the Fleeting Notes should be revisited.
	- With the help of literature or other resources, polish these notes.
	- **Using your own words**, give more depth to the Fleeting Notes.

3. Permanent Notes
	- Finally, Permanent Notes take into consideration how the Literature Notes could be linked and connected within the current [[Knowledge Management System]].
	- Links between notes should be considered and created.
	- These notes can then be integrated in the repository.
